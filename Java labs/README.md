# Java Labs Collection

This folder is a collection of my Java lab exercises from school. While the projects themselves are mostly simple practice assignments, they showcase my journey learning Java and experimenting with the language.

## Contents

- **Basic Exercises** – Simple programs to practice syntax, loops, conditionals, and basic I/O.
- **Object-Oriented Practice** – Labs exploring classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.
- **Fun Experiments** – Small side exercises where I played around with Java features and tried creative problem-solving.

## How to Run

Each lab has its own folder with `.java` files. You can compile and run them using any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans) or via the command line:

```bash
javac LabName.java
java LabName
```

## Notes

- Nothing here is a full-fledged project; it's mostly experimentation and learning.
- Some exercises may be incomplete or intentionally simple.

✨ Enjoy browsing through my early Java experiments!
