# C++ School Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of various C++ exercises and school projects I've worked on. It contains different folders, each representing a specific topic or course work. These are primarily for practice, learning, and school assignments rather than polished projects. However, C++ is my personal favorite language and I have learned the most with it. So, while it may not be useful or particulary impressive, I have kept it in for myself.

## Folder Structure

- **TP (Programming techiques)**: C++ exercises covering classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other object-oriented programming concepts.
- **ASP (Algorithms and Data Structures)**: Implementations of common data structures and algorithms, including trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and related exercises.
- **NA (Numerical Algorithms)**: Advanced algorithmic solutions for numerical computations and problem-solving.
- **Scheduling**: A C++ project implementing various scheduling algorithms for tasks and processes.
- **Huffman**: Implementation of Huffman coding for data compression.

## How to Use

Each folder contains source files (`.cpp` and `.h`) along with brief descriptions where necessary. Compile and run them using your preferred C++ compiler.

```bash
# Example compilation
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

## Notes

- These are primarily school assignments and practice projects.
- Some code may be incomplete or written for specific assignments.
- No external dependencies are required unless specified in individual folders.
