# SQL Exercises Collection

This folder contains all of my SQL exercises from school. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic queries to more advanced database manipulations and joins.

## Contents

- **Basic Queries** – SELECT statements, filtering with WHERE, ORDER BY, and basic aggregations.
- **Joins and Relationships** – INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins, plus exercises with multiple tables.
- **Advanced SQL** – Subqueries, nested queries, GROUP BY with HAVING, window functions, and views.
- **Database Management** – Creating tables, altering schemas, inserting/updating data, and basic constraints.

## How to Run

You can run the SQL exercises using any SQL environment:

- MySQL / MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- SQL Server

Simply load the `.sql` files into your database engine and execute the queries.

```sql
-- Example
source exercise1.sql;
```

## Notes

- These exercises are mostly practice and learning-oriented.
- Some queries might be designed to test specific SQL concepts rather than produce meaningful results.
- The folder is organized by topic for easy navigation.

✨ Perfect for brushing up on SQL or revisiting fundamentals!
